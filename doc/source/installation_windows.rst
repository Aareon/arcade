Installation on Windows
=======================

Arcade relies on the 'PyOpenGL' library. This library depends on another library
called 'freeGLUT.' Unfortunately last I checked, the pip installer didn't
install the freeGLUT libraries correctly. However Christoph Gohlke does have
Python libraries that work. If you go here:

Download and install "PyOpenGL" and "PyOpenGL_accelerate."
